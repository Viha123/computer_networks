- provides:
	- confidentiality: via symmetric encryption
	- integrity: via cryptographic hashing
	- authentication: via public key cryptography
- whats needed?
	- **handshake** (A, B use certificates, private keys to authenticate each other, exchange or create shared secret)
	- **key derivation**: a, B use shared secret to derive set of keys
	- **data transfer**: stream data transfer
	- **connection closure**: special messages to securely close connection.
- Message Authentication Code (MAC)
- 4 keys:
	- Kc: encryption key for data sent from client to server
	- Mc: MAC key for data sent from client to server
	- and vice versa for the server to client keys
TLS 1.3:
- only 5 choices
- requires Diffie Hellman
