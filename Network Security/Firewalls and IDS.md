- firewall: isolates organization's internal network from larger Internet, allowing some packets to pass, blocking others.
- **Why?**
	- prevent DoS attacks
	- prevent illegal modificaiton/access of internal data
	- allow only authorized access to inside network
	- three types of firewalls:
		- state packet filters
		- stateful packet filters
		- application gateways
- **stateless packet filtering**:
	- filters packet by packet. 
	- desicion to forwared/drop based on:
		- tcp syn, ack
		- tcp/udp src, dest port numbers
		- ICMP message type
		- src IP, dst IP
	- admits packets that make no sense. eg: dst port = 80, ACK bit set, even though no TCP connection is established/
- **stateful packet filtering**:
	- tracky connection setupu (SYN), teardown (FIN): determine whether incoming, outgoing packets "make sense"
	- timeout inactive connections at firewall: no longer admit packets
	- ACL augmented to indicate need to check connection state table before admitting packet
	- 
- **ACL: access control lists**
- **Application gateways**:
IDS: 
- intrusion detection system
