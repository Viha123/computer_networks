- "match" + "Action"
- action: 
	- the action can include: port-forwarding, load balancing
- in generalized forwarding: a match+action table generalizes the notion of forwarding.
- the devices that do these are called **packet switches**
- OpenFlow:
	- each entry in the match+action forwarding table is known as a **flow table** in openFlow includes:
	- flow table is essentially an API, the abstraction through which an individual packet switch's behavior can be programmed.
	- ![[Pasted image 20240319090915.png]]
	- the ingress port is referred to as the input port at the packet switch on which a packet is received.
	- important actions:
		- **forwarding**: packet may be forwarded to output port, or broadcast etc
		- **dropping**: flow table entyr with no action indicates that a matched packet should be dropped
