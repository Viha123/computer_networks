- used for intra Autonomous System routing on the internet
- link state protocol
- with OSPF the router broadcasts routing info to all the other routers and not just the neighboring router
- OSPF protocol number: 89
- some advances:
	- **security**: passwords/authentication and encryption keys
	- **multiple same-cost paths**: when multiple paths have the same costs, you can configure OSPF to use any of the paths and not just one of them
	- support for **unicast and multicast**
