- no one server that can answer all the queries
- **Q: how to map between IP address and name, and vice versa**
- DNS PROVIDES IP ADDRESS, BGP PROVIDES WAY TO GET TO THAT IP ADDRESS
- **Domain Name System**: 
	- distributed database implemented by hierarchy to many named servers
	- **application-layer protocol**: hosts, name servers, communicate to resolve names
	- note: core Internet function

- authoritative DNS servers:
	- organization's own DNS server(s) providing authoritative host name to IP mappings
- Local DNS:
	- ![[Pasted image 20240214122719.png]]
		- DNS (domain name system) servers provide the IP address, butÂ **BGP provides the most efficient way to reach that IP address**. Roughly speaking, if DNS is the Internet's address book, then BGP is the Internet's road map.

	- `dig`: gives you something
- caching, updating DNS Records:
	- once (any) name server learns mapping it caches
	- cache entries disappear after TTL
- DNS records:
	- RR (resource records) RR format: (name, value, type, ttl)
	- each DNS reply message carries one or more resource records
	- TTL describes when a resource record should be removed from the cache
	- if a DNS server is authorative for a particular hostname, then the DNS server will contain a type A record for hostname. If a server is not authorative, it may not or may contain a Type A
	- 
	- type = CNAME is alias name for some "canonical"
