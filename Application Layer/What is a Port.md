- managed by Computer's operating system
- ports allow computers to easily differentiate between different types of traffic
- HTTP - port 80
- while IP addresses enable messages to go to and from specific devices, port numbers allow targeting of specific applications within those devices
- the use of ports helps computers understand what to do with the data they receive

- Ports are a transport layer concept
- only a transport layer protocol such as TCP and UDP can indicate which port a packet should go to.
- Network protocols such as IP don't know which port to go to
### Why do firewalls sometimes specific ports?
- some might have been left open
Port 25: SMTP
Port 20,21 FTP (file transfer)
Port 22: SSH
port 80: HTTP
port 443: HTTPS
