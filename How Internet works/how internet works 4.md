#computerNetworks 
**Definitions**:
**Processing delay**: Time needed to perform an integrity check, lookup packet information in a local table and move the packet from an input link to an output link in a router.
**Queuing Delay** Time spent waiting in packet buffers for link transmission.
**Transmission delay**: Time spent transmitting packets bits into the link.
**Propagation delay**: Time need for bits to physically propagate through the transmission medium from end one of a link to the other.
**packet loss**:

throughput: network scenario:
- **bottleneck link**: link on end-end path that constrains end-end throughput
	min(Rc/Rs, R/10)

Hash:
- MD5: a hashing algorithm no longer in use because it is proved to have collisions
- 2 different texts produces same output
- sha256 or sha512 are good algorithms
- diffe and helman algorithm?
Why Layering:
- Internet protocol stack:
	- application
	- transport
	- network
	- link
	- physical
- HTTP/DNS and TLS
