#computerNetworks 
- **Access networks: digital subscriber line**: 
	- use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM (digital subscriber line)
	- data over DSL line goes to Internet, different frequencies over dedicated line
	- voice over DSL line goes to telephone net
- **Access Networks: home networks**
	- **downstream**: data that comes from server to house 
	- **upstream**: data form house to server 
	- same cable for both, but older tech might have different cables
	- fiber: TX-RX, RX-TX
- what does a **firewall** do?
	- **forward proxy**:  
	- **reverse proxy**: 
- ifconfig: get IP address of your computer
- **wireless access networks (WAN)**
	- shared wireless access network connects end system to router
	- via base station aka "access point"
	- **wlans (wireless local area networks)**
		- typically within or around building
	- **Wide area cellular access networks**:
		- provided by mobile, cellular network
- **Access Networks: enterprise networks**
	- companies, universities
	- mix of wired, wireless link tech, connecting a mix of switches and routers
	- units in Mbps (megaBITs per second), now we have around 40Gigabits per second
	- interface speeds are evolving at a slower rate than processor computation 
- **Host: sends packets of data**:
	- machines break up the data that you send into packets of length **L** bits
	- transmission rate **R** (bits/sec)
	- link transmission rate, aka links
	- bits/(bits/sec) = sec
	- transmission delay = L/R = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link
	- **how does speed test stuff work?**
- **Links: physical media**:
	- physical link: ties between transmitter and receiver
	- guided media: signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber
	- unquided media: signals propagates freely, eg. radio
	- **Twisted pair**: two insulated copper wires: two insulated copper wires. 
		- category 5: 100Mbps
		- category 6: 10Gps Ethernet
	- **Coaxial cable**
		- two concentric copper conductors
		- bidirectional
		- 
	- **Fiber optic cables**
		- glass fiber carrying ligh pulses,each pulse a bit
		- high speed P2P transmission
		- low error rate. Immune to electromagnetic nose
	- Wireless Radio
		- no wire
		- broadcast adn "half-duplex"
	- Radio link types:
		- **terrestrial microwave**
		- **satellite**
		- wireless LAN (Wifi)
		- wide-area (eg cellular)
- **Network Core**:
	- mesh of interconnected routers
	- **packet-switching**: hosts break application layer messages into **packets**
		- forward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from src to dst
		- each packet transmitted at full capacity
	- **Transmission Delay**: L/R 
	- **store and forward**: entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link
	- **end-end delay**: 2L/R assuming zero propagation 
	- you can have queuing delays like traffic
	- Packet queuing and loss: if arrival rate exceeds transmission late of link for a period of time
		- packets will queue waiting to be transmitted on output link
		- packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) in router fills up
	- IP is best effort delivery
	- Two key network-core functions
		- **forwarding**:
			- local action: move arriving packets from router's input link to appropriate router output link
		- **routing**: 
			- global action determine source destination paths taken by packets
			- routing algorithm
	- **Alternative to packet switching: circuit switching**
		- end-end resources allocated to, reserved for "call" between source and destination
		- path stitched from src to dst
		- circuit segment idkle if not used by call (no sharing)
		- commonly used in traditional telephone networks
		- **FDM and TDM**:
			- frequency division multiplexing:
				- each call allocated its own band can transmit at max rate of that narrow band
			- Time division multiplexing:
				- time divided into slots
				- each call allocated periodic slots
					- can transmit at maximum rate of frequency band but only for its time slots
