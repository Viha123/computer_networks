- Denial of Service:
	- prevent users from consuming a particular service on the server
	- usually a HTTP web server
- [[Bandwidth]]
- Attack types:
	- **Bandwidth based DOS**: server cannot accept any more requests
		- if you keep sending the max bandwidth of data
		- the server will be busy just processing the person sending a lot
		- other people will be blocked because server will be attending to the 
	- DDOS:
		- client machine which might have 10mbs, and server has 1gb/s, server can go through that really quickly
		- so what DDoS does: 
			- make 100 computers send 10mbps
			- if server notices that then server blocks the person
	- **Max connections based DOS**: maximum number of TCP connections
		- in stateful protocol, server keeps information about client in RAM
		- some resources associated with TCP connection
		- cannot keep associating TCP connections forever, sets a cap on maximum number of connections
		- APACHES 200 TCP connection
		- server will have preventative measure to timeout after certain time of inactivity
		- one machine can establish a TCP connection and keep it alive
			- it sends request to connect and sends 1 byte at a time, sends slowly, server still thinks
			- **Slowloris**
		- 
	- **Vulnerability based DOS**: zero day stuff
		- send a malicious string for a legit input, instead of sending a fixed length string, send a lot more
		- make server crash
		- malicious string that has code in it that can run on the server
